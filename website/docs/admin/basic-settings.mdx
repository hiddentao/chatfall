# Basic settings

The basic settings are as follows:

* `Flag all comments for moderation` - If enabled, all comments will be marked as _"awaiting moderation"_ by default.
* `Comment delay (seconds)` - The amount of time a user must wait before posting another comment.
* `Comments per page` - The number of comments to show per page before the _"Load more comments"_ button is shown.
