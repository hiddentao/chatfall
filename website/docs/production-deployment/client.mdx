# Client

The latest version of the Chatfall client library is always available via NPM at: [@chatfall/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chatfall/client).

This package includes both the CSS and JavaScript code needed to use the Chatfall comments widget and can be loaded via CDN using:

* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@chatfall/client@<Version/>/dist/chatfall.css
* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@chatfall/client@<Version/>/dist/chatfall.es.js

:::warning
It is important that the version of the client library matches the version of the server you are running.

To check you the server version, you can run:

```bash
chatfall --version
```
:::

Alternatively, you can use the client library provided by your Chatfall server to avoid any issues related to versioning. Taking the [tutorial server](../tutorial/start-the-server.mdx) as an example, the URLs would be:

* http://localhost:3000/chatfall.css
* http://localhost:3000/chatfall.es.js
