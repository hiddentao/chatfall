# Client

The latest version of the Chatfall client library is always available via NPM at: [@chatfall/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chatfall/client).

This package includes both the CSS and JavaScript code needed to use the Chatfall comments widget and can be loaded via CDN using:

* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@chatfall/client@latest/dist/chatfall.css
* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@chatfall/client@latest/dist/chatfall.es.js

In the [basic setup](../widget/basic-setup.mdx) docs we use the latest version of the Chatfall client. However, you can also 
load a specific version of the client library by changing the version number in the URLs above.

For example, to load version 1.0.0 of the client library you would use the following URLs:

* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@chatfall/client@1.0.0/dist/chatfall.css
* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@chatfall/client@1.0.0/dist/chatfall.es.js

:::warning
It is important that the version of the client library matches the version of the server you are running.

To check you the server version, you can run:

```bash
chatfall --version
```
:::

Alternatively, you can use the client library provided by your Chatfall server to avoid any issues related to versioning. Taking the [tutorial server](../tutorial/start-the-server.mdx) as an example, the URLs would be:

* http://localhost:3000/chatfall.css
* http://localhost:3000/chatfall.es.js
