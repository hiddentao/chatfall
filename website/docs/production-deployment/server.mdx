# Server

One of the main goals of Chatfall is to be easily deployable.

To this end, every Chatfall release includes a single binary executable with **zero dependencies**!

On Github, every release will have the following assets:

* `chatfall-server.js` - Node.js script to run using [Bun](https://bun.sh).
* `chatfall-linux-arm64` - Binary executable for Linux ARM architectures.
* `chatfall-linux-x64` - Binary executable for Linux x64/Intel/AMD architectures.
* `chatfall-macos-arm64` - Binary executable for Mac OS ARM architectures.
* `chatfall-macos-x64` - Binary executable for Mac OS x64/Intel/AMD architectures.
* `chatfall-windows-x64.exe` - Binary executable for Windows x64/Intel/AMD architectures.

You can run these binaries manually as shown in the [tutorial](../tutorial/start-the-server.mdx), though we recommend using a 
process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) in that case. 

Remember to set the correct [environment variables](../environment-variables.mdx).

## Running with Docker 

Every release of Chatfall also includes a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image hosted at https://github.com/hiddentao/chatfall/pkgs/container/chatfall.

The images are currently built for the following platforms:

* `linux/amd64`
* `linux/arm64`

To run them you need to specify the exact version of the image you want to use.

For example, assuming you want to run the image `ghcr.io/hiddentao/chatfall:v0.18.0`, you would first migrate your Chatfall database:

```bash
docker run --rm \
--env ENC_KEY=<your chatfall encryption key> \
--env DATABASE_URL="<your postgres database url>" \
ghcr.io/hiddentao/chatfall:v0.18.0 migrate-db
```

Then you would run the server:

```bash
docker run --rm \
-p 3000:3000 \
--name chatfall \
--env ENC_KEY=<your chatfall encryption key> \
--env DATABASE_URL="<your postgres database url>" \
--env MAILGUN_API_KEY=<your mailgun api key> \
--env MAILGUN_SENDER=<your mailgun sender email> \
ghcr.io/hiddentao/chatfall:v0.18.0 server
```

This starts the Chatfall server on port 3000 - access it at http://localhost:3000.

You can then shut down the server later on by running:

```bash
docker stop chatfall
```
