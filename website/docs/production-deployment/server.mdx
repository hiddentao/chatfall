# Server

One of the main goals of Chatfall is to be easily deployable.

To this end, every Chatfall release includes a single binary executable with **zero dependencies**!

On Github, every release will have the following assets:

* `chatfall-server.js` - Node.js script to run using [Bun](https://bun.sh).
* `chatfall-linux-arm64` - Binary executable for Linux ARM architectures.
* `chatfall-linux-x64` - Binary executable for Linux x64/Intel/AMD architectures.
* `chatfall-macos-arm64` - Binary executable for Mac OS ARM architectures.
* `chatfall-macos-x64` - Binary executable for Mac OS x64/Intel/AMD architectures.
* `chatfall-windows-x64.exe` - Binary executable for Windows x64/Intel/AMD architectures.

You can run these binaries manually as shown in the [tutorial](../tutorial/start-the-server.mdx), though we recommend using a 
process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) in that case. 

Remember to set the correct [environment variables](../environment-variables.mdx).

A better approach is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to containerize the Chatfall server.

_TODO: Add Docker instructions here._
