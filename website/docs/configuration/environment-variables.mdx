# Environment variables

Server-side configuration is one entirely through environment variables. You can see the list of variables and their options in 
[env.ts](https://github.com/hiddentao/chatfall/blob/main/server/src/env.ts). The following variables can be set:

* `ENC_KEY` - **REQUIRED**. The encryption key for authentication tokens. Must be a hexadecimal string of atleast length 48.
* `DATABASE_URL` - **REQUIRED**. The PostgreSQL database connection URL.
* `NODE_ENV` - The environment in which the server is running. One of `development` or `production`. Defaults to `development`.
* `PORT` - The port at which the server listens for connections. Defaults to `3000`.
* `HOSTNAME` - The hostname at which the server is available. Defaults to `localhost`.
* `MAILGUN_API_KEY` - The Mailgun API key. Defaults to empty string.
* `MAILGUN_SENDER` - The Mailgun sender email address. Defaults to empty string.
* `LOG_LEVEL` - The log level - one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`. Defaults to `info`.

Only the `ENC_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` variables are required in order to run the server for development purposes. For production 
purposes you will also want to set `NODE_ENV` to `production` and also set the `MAILGUN_API_KEY` and `MAILGUN_SENDER` variables, otherwise 
users will not be able to sign up or login.

## Setting environment variables

Environment variables can be set in a number of ways depending on the operating system you are using.

### Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS)

On Unix-like systems you can set the environment variables in your shell before running the server. For example:

```bash
$ export ENC_KEY=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
$ export DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/chatfall
$ ./chatfall-linux-x64 server
```

You can also set the environment variables inline as follows:

```bash
ENC_KEY=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/chatfall ./chatfall-linux-x64 server
```

### Windows

On Windows you can set the environment variables in the command prompt before running the server. For example:

```bash
> set ENC_KEY=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
> set DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/chatfall
> ./chatfall-windows-x64.exe server
```
